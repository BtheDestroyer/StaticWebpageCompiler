For one post on a given day:
- Year.Month.Day

For multiple posts on a given day:
- Year.Month.Day.1
- Year.Month.Day.10
- Year.Month.Day.100
- etc.

This ensure the folders will be properly ordered for the subscript.

Work-in-progress blog posts can be stored in the WIP folder to keep them from being added to the compiled webpage.
